# coagFoam
coagFoam provides a general framework for simulating platelet-mediated coagulation in OpenFOAM.

To use coagFoam, clone this repository, then compile the coagFoam solver using OpenFOAM version 9.

The baseCaseCoagFoam_Rectangle contains all of the files necessary for simulating platelet-mediated coagulation in a rectangular geometry where fluid enters the left side of the domain and exits the right side of the domain.
